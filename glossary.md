## Watts -- A Simple Model Of Global Cascades On Random Networks

* **Cascade** -- "Herd-like" behaviour of individuals based on other individuals' decisions
* **Global Cascade** -- Very large cascade
* **Sparse Network** -- (Network with low connectivity)
* **Agent** -- (Individual or node in the network)
* **Threshold Rule** -- Agents switch state if a threshold fraction of neighbors have another state
* **Regime** -- From Wikipedia: > In scientific discussions, a regime is a class of physical conditions, usually parameterised by some specific measures, where a particular physical phenomenon or boundary condition is significant. Very often a regime corresponds to a limiting condition. The region of measurable parameter space that corresponds to a regime is very often loosely defined. Examples include "the superfluid regime", "the steady state regime" or "the femtosecond regime".
  * **Low Connectivity Regime** -- Agents have few neighbors. Power law distribution of cascade sizes.
  * **High Connectivity Regime** -- Agents have many neighbors. Bimodal distribution of cascade sizes.
* **Percolation Theory** -- From Wikipedia: > Percolation Theory describes the behavior of connected clusters in a random graph
* **Self-Organized Criticality** -- Paraphrased from Wikipedia: Study of sandpiles and avalanches caused by additional sand grains
* **Local Stability** -- (Resistance of an agent against perturbations)
* **System's Stability** -- (Resistance of a network against cascades)
* **Bimodal Size Distribution** -- (Distribution with two "peaks")
* **Heterogenous Threshold** -- (Agents' thresholds differ greatly)
* **Heterogenous Degree Distribution** -- (Number of agents' neighbors varies greatly)
* **Robust** -- (High stability)
* **Fragile** -- (Low stability)
* **Shock** -- External event
