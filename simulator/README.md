# NOTE TO REVIEWERS

The application isn't terribly usable right now, but we don't have time to fix it due to looming exams.

It will be improved for the final version of the paper though, so check again then.


# Simulator

Requires OpenFL: <http://www.openfl.org/download/>

Compile and run with `lime test <target>`, where target is one of:

* `flash` (just don't)

* `html5` (does not work anymore since we need `sys.io.File`)

* `neko`

* `cpp`

Or cross compile to:

* `windows`

* `linux`

* `mac`

* `android`

Pass `-args <save>` to load a network save file.
